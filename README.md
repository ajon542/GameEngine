# GameEngine
The purpose of this project is to create a game engine in C# as well as exploring some of the
rendering techniques available through OpenTK / OpenGL.

## Current Status
The game engine is under heavy development and is currently in a prototyping or experimental stage.
It essentially contains a bunch of example scenes demonstrating different aspects of the game engine.

Now that a large chunk of the shader improvements are out of the way (it is by no means finished), the work on the UI improvements is underway. The plan is to get the UI to a point where, objects can be added and deleted using the Hierarchy View, and have their properties modifyable in an Inspector View. Additionally, the ability to save and load scenes will be very beneficial.
