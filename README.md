# GameEngine
The purpose of this project is to create a game engine in C# as well as exploring some of the
rendering techniques available through OpenTK / OpenGL.

## Current Status
The game engine is under heavy development and is currently in a prototyping or experimental stage.
It essentially contains a bunch of example scenes demonstrating different aspects of the game engine.

I am additionally looking into Unity ShaderLab and how the Cg shader language is utilized. Gaining
a better understanding of this as well as how it integrates into a game engine such as Unity will
give me some interesting ideas for this project.
