# GameEngine
The purpose of this project is to create a game engine in C# as well as exploring some of the
rendering techniques available through OpenTK / OpenGL.

## Current Status
The game engine is under heavy development and is currently in a prototyping or experimental stage.
It essentially contains a bunch of example scenes demonstrating different aspects of the game engine.
